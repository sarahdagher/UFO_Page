Patterns in UFO Sightings
Team Aliens – Sarah Dagher, Lazarus Goosby, Greg Rosen

Premise
For decades, alien life forms have watched us from the skies.  A few astute observers have caught sight of their spacecrafts, and now 80 thousand of these incidents have been collected into a database.  Our team will use machine learning to analyze this database and predict where UFO’s might be seen next.
Research Questions
Where and when are UFO sightings most common?
Can patterns in past UFO sightings be used to predict future UFO sightings?
Data in scope:
